Notes B2/B3 Comp.

all Sims @ 1000 eV

1.) Design a long (60 m) and a short (37 m) BL based on the SoTex-BL
(done)

2.) Simulate B2/B3 long vs. short and vor B2 also mith high and low beta mode 
(done)

3.) Estimate/determine the max Energy Resolution (ERes) with RayUI at the first glance by Closing the Exit Slit, set reflectivity to 100 % and look at the Beam Properties to see the ERes. Goal: at which slit opening no changes apear anymore


4.) Simulate with some other SlitOpenings (near the founded one) the BLs in RayPyNg 

5.) Compare all BLs with the same ERes. Here, the worst of all BLs only can be used. Just change the ExitSlitOpening
