# List of Simulations folders and the findings


| Folder Name   | Description    | Findings |
|-----|----------------------|----------------------|
| 1 | Firs tests  | Does not work             |
| 2 | Firs tests with KB | Does not work             |
| 3 | Using Elisa layout   | Does not work             |
| 4 | Trying Thomas design  |  works! from now one we use this |
| 5 | Exit Slit vs Energy | Min es size: 10 um     |          
| 6 | cff vs Energy    | Max cff 5.  Higher cff has higher flux.          |        
| 7 | Grating diff. order  vs energy | The most promising seems to be diffraction order 3 or 4, with 2400 l/mm grating |                
| 8 | Source UE49, diff order vs energy, cff=2.25, es=10um | Grating efficiency=10% |                
| 9 | Source UE49, slit size vs energy,cff=2.25,order=1 | Grating efficiency=10%, min es 10 um  |                
| 10 | Source UE49, cff vs energy | Grating efficiency=10%,   |   
| 10a | Beamwaist simulations |  |
